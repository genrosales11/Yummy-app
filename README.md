# Yummy App

## Description

The Yummy App was created to make finding restaurants in your city or zip code simple, easy, and quick to use. It provides reliable information about restaurants based on location from user-generated inputs. 
 
Itâ€™s ideal for users looking for quick recommendations of where to eat depending on their desired food category and price point. 
Once a user inputs their specified categories, they are also able to see a map with pins of restaurants in the area the user selects.

The restaurant information is provided by the Yelp API which includes restaurant name, address, link to Yelp page, price, number of reviews, and rating out of five.

### Technologies Used

The Yummy App was build using:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
* Bulma CSS framework
* Google Maps API
* Yelp API
* Chroma.js

### User Stories

We came up with three user stories to help guide the direction of our application. Those three included:

* As a stay-at-home parent, I want to easily find restaurants near me, so I can spend more time focusing on my family instead of cooking.

* As someone who has a budget, I want to search for budget friendly restaurants so that I can eat delicious food and stay within my budget.

* As someone who is not sure what to eat, I want to see a drop down menu of different food options so i can see different food categories.

### API Functionality 

Our user stories influenced our API functionality and user inputs that connect to the outputed values from our API's. 

The text form allows the user to input their location or zipcode that is nearest to them. They can then choose from a list of categories that they are craving, and choose the pricing amount on how much they would like to spend.
